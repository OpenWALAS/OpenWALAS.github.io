# Friday Theme

## A Bootstrap 4 portfolio and blog theme for Jekyll

* Example 1: This repo builds directly to GitHub pages, which is also the documentation:  https://sfreytag.github.io/friday-theme/
* Example 2: my own homepage, http://www.freytag.org.uk

## Get Started

Follow the [install notes](https://sfreytag.github.io/friday-theme/projects/install.html).

## Usage

The theme is free to use, but if you do use it, it would be great to hear from you. Email simon@freytag.org.uk - thanks!

## Jekyll Version

__Watch out!__ This theme uses {{site.baseurl}} throughout, so is not currently suitable for Jekyll 4. It works well with 3.8.5 and works well with GitHub Pages.
