## How to develop?

You can download the [source files](https://github.com/openWALAS/openWALAS.github.io/tree/master/src) simply. If you want, you could modify the codes. Furthermore, compile and run them freely.

## Compiling environments

  - Suggested program platform
    - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) +  [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) for the non-GUI of openWALAS.
    - [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) for the GUI of openWALAS.
  - GCC (or  [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) on Windows) or the other C/C++ compiler
  - Dependent libraries of openWALAS: [gsl](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [Qwt](Qwt), [openCV](https://opencv.org/)
    - non-GUI codes only depend on gsl.
    - GUI program depend on gsl, Qt, Qwt, openCV.
  - Support openMP (parallels on thread level)
    - Compile option '-fopenmp'

## Develop form

- The communication group will be established in the later stage.

- In the present stage, the developers could Email (pycssrc@qq.com) to the projects.
