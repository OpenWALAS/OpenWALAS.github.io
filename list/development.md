  -  [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) +  [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) for the non-GUI of openWALAS.
  - [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) for the GUI of openWALAS.
  - GCC (or  [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) on Windows) or the other C/C++ compiler
  - Dependent Libraries of openWALAS: [gsl](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [Qwt](Qwt), [openCV](https://opencv.org/)
    - non-GUI codes only depend on gsl.
    - GUI program depend on gsl, Qt, Qwt, openCV.

## Develop form

- The communication group will be established in the later stage.
