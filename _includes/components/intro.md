OpenWALAS (***open*** ***Wa***ve ***L***oads ***A***nalysis ***S***oftware) is a suit of fluid-structural interaction software aiming to numerically calculate the motions, wave loads and hydroelastic responses of marine structures in waves, which is based on three-dimensional potential theory and mode superposition principle of elastic structures. And the velocity and pressure are respectively solved by 3D boundary element method in frequency domain and time domain, considering forward speed, multi-body and nonlinear factors (nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force, nonlinear incident wave exciting force and slamming pressure), as well as the function of eliminating irregular frequencies of floating structures in frequency domain. 

The project of OpenWALAS, maintained by Dr. Peng Yang on <a href="https://github.com/OpenWALAS/OpenWALAS.github.io">GitHub</a> and was built originally for Yangâ€™s own research, intends to supply a suit of free (or opensource) software to scientists and engineers all over the world.
