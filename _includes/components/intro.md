OpenWALAS is a suit of fluid-structural softwares aiming to numerically calculate wave loads and hydroelastic responses in waves, which is based on three-dimensional potential theory and mode superposition principle of elastic structures. And the velocity and pressure are solved by boundary element method in frequency domain and time domain, respectively, considering forward speed and nonlinear factors (nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force, nonlinear incident wave exciting force and slamming pressure). The software could also assess motion and solve sea-keeping problem. The project of openWALAS intends to supply free (or opensource) software to the scientists and engineers.

It is maintained by Peng Yang on <a href="https://github.com/openWALAS/openWALAS.github.io">GitHub</a> and it was built originally for Yangâ€™s own research.
