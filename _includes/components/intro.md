OpenWALAS is a suit of fluid-structural interaction software aiming to numerically calculate the motions, wave loads and hydroelastic responses of marine structures on waves, which is based on three-dimensional potential theory and mode superposition principle of elastic structures. And the velocity and pressure are respectively solved by 3D boundary element method in frequency domain and time domain, considering forward speed, multi-body and nonlinear factors (nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force, nonlinear incident wave exciting force and slamming pressure). 

The project of openWALAS intends to supply free (or opensource) software to the scientists and engineers all over the world.

It is maintained by Dr. Peng Yang on <a href="https://github.com/openWALAS/openWALAS.github.io">GitHub</a> and it was built originally for Yangâ€™s own research.
