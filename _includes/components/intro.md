OpenWALAS (***Open*** ***Wa***ve ***L***oad ***A***nalysis ***S***oftware) is a suit of fluid-structural interaction software aiming to numerically calculate the motions, wave loads and hydroelastic responses of marine structures in waves, which is based on three-dimensional potential theory and mode superposition principle of elastic structures, as well as Morison's equation. And the velocity and pressure are respectively solved by 3D boundary element method (**BEM**) in frequency domain and time domain, considering forward speed, multi-body and nonlinear factors (nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force, nonlinear incident wave exciting force and slamming pressure), as well as the function of eliminating irregular frequencies of floating structures and second-order forces (QTF, middle-field integral and far-field momentum) in frequency domain. 

The project of OpenWALAS,  maintained by Dr. Peng Yang on <a href="https://github.com/OpenWALAS/OpenWALAS.github.io">GitHub</a> and built originally for Yangâ€™s own research, intends to supply a suit of free (or opensource) software to scientists and engineers all over the world.
